Or, when you run a completely unsupported system, you run into issues. Or, you just don't run vanilla.

Everything in here is a patch meant to be applied to code. Some of these might be from distros, but hard to find. Some might be on a bug tracker. Some might be downright custom.

They either fix a bug, fix a build, or change functionality. Point is, I have a lot of them.
