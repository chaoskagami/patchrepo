# patchrepo
Or, when you run a completely unsupported system, you run into issues. Or, you just don't run vanilla.

Everything in here is a patch meant to be applied to code. Some of these might be from distros, but hard to find. Some might be on a bug tracker. Some might be downright custom.

They either fix a bug, fix a build, or change functionality. Point is, I have a lot of them.

aria2/
    aria2-1.19.0-leech.patch
        Adds a --disable-seed option. Does what you expect.
wget/
    wget-no-egd-libressl.patch
        Removes reference to egd so libressl is usable.
libvpx/
    libvpx-1.4.0_1.3.0backcompat.patch
        Adds some #defines to enable *some* backcompatibility with libvpx 1.3.0. This is enough to build pale moon against it.
links/
    links-no-egd-libressl.patch
        See the wget patch.
sdl/
    sdl-xdata.patch
        Fixes 'Undefined symbol _XData32' which occurs in some circumstances.
